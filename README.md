# Croatian Landmarks - SwiftUI Project


Explore Croatia's beautiful nature with this app. You may think that Croatia is all about beaches and historic towns, but there is actually a lot more that this versatile country has to offer. There are 8 stunning national parks and 11 nature parks. You can see all of them in this project with location, pictures and a short description.
I built this project following Apple SwiftUI Tutorial - Landmarks.
